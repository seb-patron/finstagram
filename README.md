# Finstagram README

![Alt text](https://github.com/seb-patron/finstagram/blob/master/finstagram-preview.png "Instagram Clone")
This app is a clone of Instagram written in Ruby on Rails.

A few key things about this app:
- Devise gem is used for authentication. I extended Devise to include a User's name and username in the model.
- Active Storage is used for handling images.
- file_validators gem is used to verify uploaded file is an image, and that image is no larger than 500kb.
- Tachyons CSS is used for styling


The Tachyons CSS framework is used for styling.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version: ruby 2.4.0

* Rails version: rails 5.2.0 (5.2 or up must be used in order to use Active Storage)
